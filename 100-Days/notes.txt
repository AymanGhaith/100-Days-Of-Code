3-65
    - inline elements special rules for margin and padding top and bottom:
        surrounded element's margin ends on the content of the anchor (inline element)
        if there is padding and the previous block element (p) has no margin, the anchor element will be displayed over the paragraph
        we can solve this by adding margin for the p element which will push the content of the anchor.
        but much better is by using the display property of the anchor to block. or much better inline-block.
    - display: inline-block or block.

3-66
